  abstract  = {We focus on email-based attacks, a rich field with well-publicized consequences. We show how current Natural Language Generation (NLG) technology allows an attacker to generate masquerade attacks on scale, and study their effectiveness with a within-subjects study. We also gather insights on what parts of an email do users focus on and how users identify attacks in this realm, by planting signals and also by asking them for their reasoning. We find that: (i) 17\% of participants could not identify any of the signals that were inserted in emails, and (ii) Participants were unable to perform better than random guessing on these attacks. The insights gathered and the tools and techniques employed could help defenders in: (i) implementing new, customized anti-phishing solutions for Internet users including training next-generation email filters that go beyond vanilla spam filters and capable of addressing masquerade, (ii) more effectively training and upgrading the skills of email users, and (iii) understanding the dynamics of this novel attack and its ability of tricking humans.},

As the use of language generation technologies becomes more widespread, the problem arises of determining whether a given text is machine generated or not. Task 8 at SemEval 2024 consists of a shared task with this exact objective. Our approach aims at developing models and strategies that strike a good balance between performance and model size. We show that it is possible to compete with large transformer-based solutions with smaller systems.}

Our best system, LLMixtic, is a Transformer Encoder that mixes token-level probabilistic features extracted from four LLaMA-2 models. We obtained the best results in the official ranking (96.88{\%} accuracy), showing a false positive ratio of 4.38{\%} and a false negative ratio of 1.97{\%} on the test set. We further study LLMixtic through ablation, probabilistic, and attention analyses, finding that (i) performance improves as more LLMs and probabilistic features are included, (ii) LLMixtic puts most attention on the features of the last tokens, (iii) it fails on samples where human text probabilities become consistently higher than for generated text, and (iv) LLMixtic{'}s false negatives exhibit a bias towards text with newlines.}
